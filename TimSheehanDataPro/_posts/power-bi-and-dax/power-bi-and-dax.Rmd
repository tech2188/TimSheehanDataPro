```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

The biggest tip i can say is making a custom rolling calendar. This is the M Code to start it.

let
    Source = #date(2017, 1, 1),
    Custom1 = List.Dates(Source, Number.From(DateTime.LocalNow())- Number.From(Source) ,#duration(1,0,0,0)),
    #"Converted to Table" = Table.FromList(Custom1, Splitter.SplitByNothing(), null, null, ExtraValues.Error),
    #"Changed Type" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#"Converted to Table",{{"Column1", type date}}),
    
  
  
  Its a good idea to hide your forigen keys in report view to prevent poor filtering processes. this prevents relationships/joins with missing key values unless that is a desired feature( using a relationship as an implicit filter)
